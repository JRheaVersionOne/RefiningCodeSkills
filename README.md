# RefiningCodeSkills
This will hold code that I will refresh myself in whether it be algorithms I am relearning on and new projects ideas want to start and save for later.

# Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to push myself to code more in C# and understand more how C# is being use in effecient and effectives ways and better understand what
is good code practice to repeatively learn and grow on. 

# Comments
Feel free to comment on anything on my work and my progress. I'm still learning to become a better programmer, so constructive comments are welcome.

#Inital start 1/14/2021
Even though I code in C# for a few years, there are some aspects of the language I may have forgotten or lack in knowledge but the start of the journey is better now
than never xD.
